# Meeting Prep

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "prep for meeting", "meeting prep", "prepare for my meeting".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. What is the meeting about?
2. Who will be there? (roles)
3. What do you need from this meeting? (decision, alignment, info-sharing)
4. Any pre-existing tensions or context?

### Step 2: Generate Prep

**Meeting Context**
- Purpose: [1 sentence]
- Your role in this meeting: [driver / participant / observer]

**Key People**
For each attendee:
- What they care about
- Likely questions or objections
- How to frame things for them

**Your Talking Points**
- 3-5 points you need to make, in order of importance
- For each: the point, the evidence, the ask

**Potential Objections**
- 2-3 objections you might face
- Your response to each

**Questions to Ask**
- 3-5 questions that show you've done your homework
- Questions that move the meeting toward your desired outcome

**Desired Outcome**
- What does success look like when you walk out?
- What's the minimum acceptable outcome?

## Rules
- Prep should take 5 minutes to read, not 30 minutes
- Focus on what YOU need to say and do, not a general meeting guide
- If the meeting is a negotiation, include BATNA (best alternative)
- If it's a review, include the key metrics and talking points around them
