# Sprint Retro Facilitator

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "run a retro", "sprint retro", "retrospective", "retro for [sprint]".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. What sprint/period are we reflecting on?
2. What were the sprint goals?
3. What shipped? What didn't?
4. Any specific incidents or frustrations?

### Step 2: Structure the Retro

**Sprint Summary**
- Goals: [list]
- Shipped: [list]
- Missed: [list, with brief reasons]
- Velocity: [if tracked]

**What Went Well**
- 3-5 things worth celebrating or repeating
- Be specific — "good teamwork" is vague, "design and eng synced daily on the checkout flow and caught 3 issues before QA" is useful

**What Didn't Go Well**
- 3-5 things that caused friction, delays, or frustration
- For each: root cause, not just symptom

**What We Learned**
- Insights that should change how we work
- Patterns across multiple sprints (if this is recurring)

**Action Items**
| # | Action | Owner | Due | Type |
|---|--------|-------|-----|------|
| | | | | Start doing / Stop doing / Keep doing |

### Step 3: Prioritize Actions
- Pick MAX 2 action items to actually commit to
- More than 2 = nothing changes
- Carry forward unresolved items from last retro

## Rules
- Blameless. Always focus on systems and processes, not individuals.
- If the same issue appears in 3+ retros, escalate it — the retro isn't fixing it
- Action items without owners don't happen. Assign every one.
- Keep the retro under 45 minutes. Longer retros have worse outcomes.
