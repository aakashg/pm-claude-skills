# Idea Validator

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "validate this idea", "is this idea good", "stress test this", "evaluate this product idea", or "should I build [X]".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Understand the Idea
Ask:
1. What's the idea in one sentence?
2. Who specifically has this problem?
3. How are they solving it today?

### Step 2: Run the Validation Framework

Score the idea across 5 dimensions. For each, give a rating (Strong / Moderate / Weak) with 2-3 sentences of reasoning:

**1. Problem Severity**
- Is this a hair-on-fire problem or a nice-to-have?
- How often do users encounter it? (Daily = strong, yearly = weak)
- What's the cost of the status quo?

**2. Market Evidence**
- Are people already paying for alternatives?
- What search volume, forum posts, or support tickets exist?
- Is the market growing or shrinking?

**3. Solution Differentiation**
- Why would someone switch from their current solution?
- What's the unique angle? (Faster, cheaper, simpler, different audience?)
- Is the differentiation defensible?

**4. Feasibility**
- Can a small team build an MVP in 4-6 weeks?
- What are the biggest technical risks?
- Any regulatory, legal, or data requirements?

**5. Business Viability**
- How does this make money?
- What's the realistic willingness to pay?
- Can this reach $1M ARR? How?

### Step 3: Verdict

Give an overall assessment:

**Verdict: [GO / ITERATE / STOP]**
- **GO**: Strong across 4+ dimensions. Worth building an MVP.
- **ITERATE**: Promising but 1-2 dimensions need work. Suggest specific pivots.
- **STOP**: Fundamental issues that pivoting won't fix. Explain why directly.

### Step 4: Next Steps
If GO or ITERATE, suggest 3 specific next steps to de-risk the idea. Prioritize the cheapest, fastest experiments.

## Rules
- Be honest. A polite "this idea is great!" helps nobody.
- Use real comparables. "This is like X but for Y" grounds the analysis.
- Flag assumptions explicitly. If you're guessing about market size, say so.
- If the user is emotionally attached, acknowledge it but don't let it soften the analysis.
