# Onboarding Reviewer

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "review onboarding", "onboarding audit", "improve onboarding", "onboarding feedback".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. Describe the current onboarding flow (or paste screenshots/screen descriptions)
2. What's the activation metric?
3. Current activation rate and target
4. Who is the target user?

### Step 2: Audit the Flow

**Current Flow Assessment**
| Step | What Happens | User Effort | Value Delivered | Drop-off Risk |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|

**Time to Value**
- How many steps before the user gets value?
- How many minutes does the full flow take?
- What's the fastest possible path to the aha moment?

**Friction Points**
For each friction point:
- Where it happens
- Why it's a problem
- Suggested fix
- Expected impact on activation

**Missing Elements**
- Empty states that don't guide the user
- Missing progress indicators
- No fallback for users who drop off

**Recommendations** (ranked by impact)
1. [Highest impact change — usually removing a step]
2. [Second highest — usually adding value earlier]
3. [Third — usually better empty states or defaults]

## Rules
- The fastest path to the aha moment wins. Cut everything else.
- Every screen must deliver value, not just collect information
- Pre-fill everything you can. Don't ask questions you can infer.
- Mobile and desktop might need different flows
- Test with someone who's never seen the product. Your perspective is biased.
