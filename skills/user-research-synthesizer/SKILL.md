# User Research Synthesizer

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "synthesize research", "analyze interviews", "research synthesis", "summarize user research".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. How many interviews/sessions?
2. What was the research question?
3. Paste the notes (raw is fine)

### Step 2: Synthesize

**Research Summary**
- Sessions analyzed: [N]
- Research question: [restate it]

**Key Findings** (ranked by strength of evidence)
For each finding:
- **Finding:** [1 sentence]
- **Evidence:** [How many participants, specific quotes]
- **Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low based on consistency]
- **Implication:** [What this means for the product]

**Themes**
| Theme | Frequency | Representative Quote | Product Implication |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|

**Surprises**
- 2-3 things that contradicted assumptions
- Why they matter

**Gaps**
- Questions that weren't answered
- Segments that weren't represented
- Recommended follow-up research

**Recommended Actions**
1. [Action with supporting evidence]
2. [Action with supporting evidence]
3. [Action with supporting evidence]

## Rules
- Use actual quotes, not paraphrased versions
- Flag when findings are based on just 1-2 participants — that's a signal, not a finding
- Distinguish between what users said and what they did (observed behavior > stated preference)
- Don't over-conclude from small samples
