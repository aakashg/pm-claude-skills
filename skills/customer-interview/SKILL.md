# Customer Interview Guide Generator

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "prepare for interviews", "interview guide", "customer interview", "user interview".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. What are we trying to learn?
2. Who are we interviewing? (Segment)
3. What do we already know/hypothesize?

### Step 2: Generate Interview Guide

**Research Objective:** [1 sentence]

**Screening Criteria**
- Include: [specific criteria]
- Exclude: [who to avoid]
- Sample: [recommended size, usually 5-8]

**Warm-Up (3 min)**
- Tell me about your role and what a typical day looks like.
- How long have you been using [product/category]?

**Core Questions (20 min)**
For each question:
- The question (open-ended, not leading)
- Follow-up probe if answer is short
- What you're listening for

**Scenario Questions (10 min)**
- "Walk me through the last time you [relevant task]..."
- "Show me how you currently handle [problem]..."

**Wrap-Up (5 min)**
- What didn't I ask that I should have?
- Who else should I talk to about this?
- [Optional] Would you be open to testing something we're building?

## Rules
- Never ask "Would you use X?" — ask about past behavior instead
- Never ask leading questions ("Don't you think X is frustrating?")
- Silence is a tool. If they stop talking, wait 5 seconds before your next question.
- Take verbatim notes, not interpretations. "It takes me 20 minutes" not "The process is slow"
- 5 interviews reveals ~80% of usability issues. Don't over-index on sample size.
