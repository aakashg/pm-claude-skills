# LinkedIn Post Writer

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "write a LinkedIn post", "draft a LinkedIn post", "LinkedIn post about [topic]", or "turn this into a LinkedIn post".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Get the Core Idea
Ask:
1. What's the one insight or takeaway?
2. Who is the target audience?
3. Any specific hook or angle you want?

If the user provides raw notes, a thread, or an article link — extract the insight yourself and confirm before writing.

### Step 2: Write the Post

Follow this structure:

**Hook (Line 1-2):**
- Pattern interrupt. Bold claim, surprising stat, or counterintuitive take.
- Must work on mobile — the first 2 lines decide if someone clicks "see more."
- No "I'm excited to announce..." or "Thrilled to share..." — ever.

**Setup (Lines 3-5):**
- Context. Why should they care? What's the problem or situation?
- One short paragraph. 2-3 sentences max.

**Body (Lines 6-15):**
- The core content. Use one of these formats:
  - **Numbered list** (3-7 items) — best for tips, lessons, frameworks
  - **Story arc** (situation → complication → resolution) — best for personal experiences
  - **Before/after** — best for transformations and results
- Use line breaks between every 1-2 sentences. LinkedIn penalizes walls of text.
- Be specific. "Revenue went up 23%" beats "Revenue improved significantly."

**CTA (Last 2 lines):**
- Ask a question, invite a reaction, or point to a resource.
- Keep it simple. One CTA, not three.

### Formatting Rules
- Max 1,300 characters (LinkedIn truncates longer posts in feed)
- One emoji max, and only if it adds meaning
- No hashtags in the body. If the user wants them, add 3-5 at the very end.
- Short paragraphs. 1-2 sentences each.
- Use "→" or "—" for visual breaks instead of bullet points

### Step 3: Offer Variations
After the first draft, offer: "Want me to try a different hook, make it shorter, or adjust the tone?"

## Rules
- Never start with "I'm excited" or "Thrilled to share"
- Never use the word "delve" or "landscape"
- Always lead with value, not self-promotion
- If the post is about the user's product, lead with the problem it solves, not the product name
- Write like a person, not a brand. Conversational > corporate.
