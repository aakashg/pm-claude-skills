# Competitor Tracker

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "track competitor", "competitor update", "what's [competitor] doing", "competitive intel".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. Which competitor?
2. What specifically triggered this? (New feature launch, pricing change, funding round, etc.)
3. What's our product/feature area that overlaps?

### Step 2: Analyze

**Competitor Update Summary**
- Company: [name]
- What changed: [specific update]
- Date: [when]
- Source: [where you found this]

**Impact Assessment**

- Does this affect our roadmap? [Yes/No — explain]
- Does this affect our sales conversations? [Yes/No — explain]

**What They Got Wrong (or Missed)**

**Our Response Options**
| Option | Effort | Impact | Timeline |

## Rules
- Don't panic-react to every competitor move. Most don't matter.
- Distinguish between announced and shipped. Announcements aren't products.
- Focus on what this means for YOUR users, not the competitor's users.
- Track patterns over time, not just individual moves.
