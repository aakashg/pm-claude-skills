# Data Storyteller

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "tell the data story", "turn this data into a narrative", "data narrative", "present this data".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. What's the data? (Paste numbers, charts, or describe)
2. Who is the audience? (Exec, team, board, cross-functional)
3. What decision should this data inform?

### Step 2: Build the Narrative

**Headline** (1 sentence that captures the insight)
[The single most important thing the audience should take away]

**Context**
- What was the baseline/expectation?
- What time period are we looking at?
- Any external factors to account for?

**The Story** (3-part structure)
1. **Setup**: Here's what we expected / what we were trying to do
2. **Conflict**: Here's what actually happened (the interesting finding)
3. **Resolution**: Here's what it means and what we should do

**Supporting Data**
- 2-3 key numbers that support the narrative
- For each: the number, what it means, why it matters
- Comparison points (vs last quarter, vs benchmark, vs goal)

**What This Doesn't Tell Us**
- Limitations of the data
- Alternative explanations
- What we'd need to investigate further

**Recommendation**
- Based on this data, here's what I recommend we do
- Here's what I recommend we stop doing
- Here's what we need more data on

## Rules
- Lead with the insight, not the methodology
- One chart, one message. Don't put 5 insights on one slide.
- Always compare: vs last period, vs goal, vs benchmark
- Execs want: so what? What do we do? Answer that first.
- Caveat your data honestly. Cherry-picked data destroys trust when someone finds the full picture.
