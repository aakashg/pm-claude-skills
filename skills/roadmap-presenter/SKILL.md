# Roadmap Presenter

## Trigger
Activate when the user asks to "present roadmap", "roadmap deck", "roadmap presentation", "communicate roadmap".

## Behavior

### Step 1: Gather Context
Ask:
1. Who is the audience? (Board, exec team, all-hands, eng team, customers)
2. What time horizon? (Quarter, half, year)
3. What's the roadmap? (Paste or describe the initiatives)
4. Any sensitive topics to navigate?

### Step 2: Structure the Presentation

**Slide 1: Where We Are**
- Key metrics (current state, trend)
- 1-2 sentences on momentum

**Slide 2: Where We're Going**
- Vision statement (1 sentence)
- 3 strategic themes/pillars

**Slide 3-5: The Roadmap** (one per theme/pillar)
For each theme:
- Why this matters (connect to metrics or strategy)
- What we're building (specific initiatives, not vague goals)
- Expected outcome (metric impact)
- Timeline (Now / Next / Later — NOT specific dates unless committed)

**Slide 6: What We're NOT Doing**
- 2-3 things you explicitly chose against
- Brief reasoning (shows strategic thinking)

**Slide 7: Risks & Dependencies**
- Top 2-3 risks
- What we need from other teams

**Slide 8: How We'll Know It's Working**
- Key metrics and targets
- Check-in cadence

### Step 3: Tailor for Audience
- Board: Focus on strategy, market position, and metrics. Cut implementation details.
- Exec team: Strategy + resourcing asks. Be clear about tradeoffs.
- Eng team: Include technical context and architecture decisions. Show why this order.
- Customers: Show value delivery timeline. NO internal priorities or tech details.

## Rules
- Never put dates on a roadmap slide unless you're committing to them
- Use Now/Next/Later instead of Q1/Q2/Q3 — it gives flexibility
- Lead with WHY before WHAT. The audience needs to buy the problem before the solution.
- "What we're NOT doing" is often the most valuable slide. It shows strategic discipline.
